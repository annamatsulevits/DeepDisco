Hello dear future DeepDisco usesr!

For an online tutorial and a full presentation of the methodology underlying DeepDisco, please watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcsmsOFhJtM

In order to start, please clone the entire DeepDisco repository, make sure Python3 is installed on your device and depending on your operating system (Linux, MacOS, or Windowns), click on the correct command that will run a script from your terminal:

- Linux: DeepDisco.command
- MacOS: DeepDisco.desktop
- Windows: DeepDisco.bat

In case of troubles or permission issues, you can also install the dependencies manually by running 'manual_installation_pip.sh' or 'manual_installation_win.bat'. On Linux, some users might need to change the permissions by executing the command found here 'linux_execute.txt'.

For further troubleshooting, please don't hestitate to contact the support at anna.matsulevits@u-bordeaux.fr.

Thank you very much for using DeepDisco and don't forget to cite us! :)
